**i do not like this thing!!! and so i am getting rid of it!!!**

*literally anyone could make this!!!*
*it is one (1) line!! (excluding metadata)*

if this stops working i probably won't fix it

just download [noactivitylist.theme.css](https://github.com/instntpot/no-activity-list/blob/main/noactivitylist.theme.css) and put it in your themes folder!
~if~ ~you~ ~use~ ~vencord~ ~you~ ~can~ ~also~ ~paste~ [~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instntpot/no-activity-list/main/noactivitylist.theme.css~](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instntpot/no-activity-list/main/noactivitylist.theme.css) ~into~ ~online~ ~themes~
